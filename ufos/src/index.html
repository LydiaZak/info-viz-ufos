                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>The first (well) known UFO sighting was in 1947. While flying his small plane, Kenneth Arnold, saw a
                    group of nine high-speed objects near Mount Rainier in Washington. He estimated the speed of the
                    saucer-shaped objects as several thousand miles per hour. Since then, hundreds of thousands of
                    UFO sightings have been submitted as possible proof of extraterrestrial evidence, with a significant
                    increase in the past 20 years. As part of our course requirement for CS 7295, we wanted to
                    analyze and bring life to these reportings with effective visualizations for others to
                    formulate their own opinions.<br/><br/>

                <p>
                    The dataset that is used is from the National UFO Research Center. The dataset contains over
                    80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century, and it was geolocated and time standardized
                    by Sigmond Axel. The data contains city, state, time, description, and duration of each sighting
                    and gives detailed descriptions of each sighting by Peter Davenport, the Director of the National
                    UFO Reporting Center in Washington State.

                <p>The number of reported UFO Sightings has drastically increased in the last 20 years, nearly tripling since
                    2001. What areas in the country are most likely to have UFO sightings? How have the sightings
                    changed year over year? What are common shapes or descriptions? In attempt to answer these questions,
                    we've created data visualizations using D3 in order to better understand these questions.<br/><br/>

                <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s clear to see that there has been a massive increase in reported UFO Sightings in the United States
                    since 1910. California has had the most reported sightings, and Washington State, Texas, New York,
                    and Florida have about have of the number of sightings. The majority of sightings look to cluster
                    in cities or well populated areas. With respect to shape, year after year, it looks like the most
                    reported shapes/forms of UFOs are light and disk. Over all, there doesn’t seem to be a correlation
                    between the number of sightings and the duration.

                    Through the data collection efforts by the NUFORC, who has made this data publicly available data,
                    we have the tools to understand the areas of the country that are most likely to have UFO sightings
                    cumulatively and year over year, the most common UFO shape description, and how duration of the
                    sighting comes into the picture in order to help people formulate their own opinions. For future
                    enhancements, we'd like to overlay other data such as weather, airport locations, lighthouse locations,
                    and government research centers to help validate the sighting.
